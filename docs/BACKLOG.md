**Last updated:** 2026-09-21, night (**redesign STAGES 2 and 3 are built and owner-QA'd in one
session** — the whole Unit Frames tab and the whole Bars tab draw from the kit, at their mocks'
coordinates; `LibGloomSkin` is at **MINOR 12** (the colour chip, the picker's colour sources, the
short and bare dials, `UI.cell`, the revised dropdown list, the kit popover). **Next: stage 4, the
Auras tab (7 mocks), item 16.**)

## Open items

### 16 · ★ THE SUITE UI REDESIGN — stage 4 next: the Auras tab
**Repo:** `~/GloomsAuras` (the seven panels), `~/GloomsHub` for anything the kit still lacks · **Size:** ONE stage per session; stage 4 is a full session · **Evidence:** stages 1–3 owner-QA'd 2026-09-21 (Unit Frames ×7 and Bars ×10 built from the mocks and reviewed panel by panel)

The owner: *"I've grown to hate how it looks."* He mocked it all in Figma, file page **"GloomSuite UI"
(node `646:144`)**: 24 screens at **1060 × 740** plus a **PRIMITIVES** frame (`674:13578`). The
Auras screens, in mock order: Trigger `648:376` · Appearance `649:704` · Bar Fill `650:1390` · Text
`650:1615` · Effects & Motion `651:1788` · Sounds `651:1925` · Load Conditions `651:2206` (the
full list is one `get_metadata` on the page). ⚠ **The app-side Figma connector lists zero tools
even when the server is up.** Drive the server directly: **`~/GloomsHub/tools/figma.py`** (its
docstring has the three calls). `get_metadata` gives every control's x/y; `get_screenshot` the
look; `get_design_context` colours and fonts. ⚠ **`get_metadata` may prefix the tree with a
"Currently selected nodes" line — join every `content[].text` before parsing.**

**STAGES 1–3 ARE DONE** (2026-09-21): the shell, the kit (CONTRACTS §4, MINOR 12), the Unit Frames
tab (Global with its default font · Health / Power / Class Resource / Cast as ONE panel with an arc
face and a bar face · Texts · Auras) and the Bars tab (the rail with the kit preset block over the
dark preview pane, the accordion, all ten sections, GB's profile row in the footer).
**The transition theme** — the pre-kit widgets draw dark text and light plates so the un-migrated
tabs (Auras, Overlays, Portraits, Media) stay usable — is scaffolding; it goes with stage 5.

**How a stage goes (the method that worked for 2 and 3):** per mock, list every control with its
body-relative x/y (`headerY + 36` is the body's top; headers 26 apart), build each at THOSE numbers
— **no inferred columns** (the owner: "I put things where they are for a reason") — with the kit's
cells (`UI.cell` + `UI.segments / toggleBar / chip / pick / dial`), reload, he looks. Per-mock segment
padding differs (four-way bars ~8, three-way ~10, two-way 20); read the frame widths.

**Decisions taken (do not re-ask):**
- **Window 1060 × 740, fixed.** Content 1060 × 585 with a footer profile row, 1060 × 650 without. CONTRACTS §2.
- **The scrub dial replaces every slider** — definition in `UI.dial`'s header; **do not redesign it**.
  It has a `short` form (78px strip, the mocks' 133px dial) and a `bare` form (no label, for table rows).
- **Buttons:** dark = an action or an unchosen chip, violet = the chosen one / persisting state,
  amber = destructive, 50% = unavailable. **Segmented bars sit on the LIGHT track** (dim 50%);
  a two-way bar flips when its lit side is clicked. **Links / actions are violet** ("(Remove)").
- **Colour swatches are SQUARE** (the one kit surface without corners). "(Remove)" only on optional
  colours; removed = the engine's default. A chip holds a fixed colour OR a source.
- **Colour SOURCES live in the picker** ("Use Class / Power / Resource Color" buttons): picking one
  SELECTS it — the button lights, the field takes the source's colour, the consumer previews live —
  and **OK commits it**; Cancel restores. The "use class colour" toggles are gone (the Texts mock
  still draws one; it was deliberately not built).
- **Disabled by another setting = 50%, never hidden.** Hide only the other MODE's face (arc vs bar).
- **Collapsing the open section scrolls to the top** so every header shows.
- **ONE layer control** per element: Global's strata + level, each element inherits or overrides
  with the Layer Override plate (OFF|ON · Layer · Level field). Texts and aura groups got it too.
- **The dropdown list** is the owner's revised look (Figma "Dropdown" `682:14067`): plate grey, dim
  rim on three sides, 14px rows, the current row a 20% violet band, centred under the button.
- **Modals dim the Suite WINDOW only**; the picker never dims. The kit POPOVER (GU's filter panel)
  wears the picker's night plate + indigo rim.
- **GU Visibility has "Never"**: the frame hides at once and every other section header dims.
- **GU aura filters:** the spell-ID lists are GONE (engine and panel) — "three of four cases isn't
  good enough, and is just confusing." Only the class tri-states + Only Timed remain.
- **GB:** the master switch and the preset-highlight button live at the end of the Layout section's
  button row (the owner's pick from three options); the aura-icon "dark edge" toggle was dropped
  (not in the mock; the saved value still applies); the old font flyout that previewed each font in
  its own face is gone — the kit list shows names in Play (**he has not asked for the preview back**).

**Stage 4 — the seven Auras panels** in mock order (Trigger · Appearance · Bar Fill · Text ·
Effects & Motion · Sounds · Load Conditions). GA's tab is the most complex (the list + editor, the
`AuraContainer` bars, the frozen decisions in its HANDOFF) — **read its `CLAUDE.md` and
`docs/HANDOFF.md` before touching it.** Then stage 5 (Overlays, Portraits, Media from the kit alone,
the Suite SETTINGS tab with the UI-scale control, and retiring the transition theme).

**Read first:** the Trigger screen (`648:376`) through the server · the `★ THE KIT` section of
`~/GloomsHub/Skin.lua` (every widget's header comment is its spec) · [CONTRACTS.md](CONTRACTS.md)
§2 and §4's kit block · `~/GloomsAuras/CLAUDE.md` and `~/GloomsAuras/docs/HANDOFF.md` · for the
pattern, `kitRingSection` in `~/GloomsUnitFrames/GloomsUnitFrames_Tab.lua` and `buildLayoutSection`
in `~/GloomsBars/Config.lua`

### 12 · Gloom's Unit Frames — what is left
**Repo:** `~/GloomsUnitFrames` · **Size:** watching, then small pieces · **Evidence:** bar mode owner-QA'd 2026-09-21 (FINDINGS §21)

**Done 2026-09-21:** BAR MODE on health / power / cast / resource (shape · size · rotation · fill
direction · track · gradient · shift · absorb overlay · outline) · per-display strata + level
(level = the display's lowest piece; a bar spans +6, an arc +15) · outline in either mode, three
widths · the bar's own offset, separate from the arc's · `/gu bar <ring> …` QA command (keep it).

**Left, in order:**
1. **A TARGET's cast in bar mode under secrecy** — `SetTimerDuration` from the duration object,
   `UNTESTED` there (§21). Needs a delve or a casting mob; he just looks.
2. **The shield wash switching OFF** (arc mode) — still only ever seen on the probe square (§19).
3. **Aura filter CLASSES** beyond timed-only and cast-by-you — `UNTESTED` individually.
4. **The aura PREVIEW's alignment** against a live group — unverified; a one-number fix if off.
5. **Flips for non-symmetric bar shapes** — a mirrored file per shape + a "Mirror" choice; only
   matters for the crescent set. Masks refuse flipped texcoords (§21).
6. **The Gu mark** — still the Hub's logo. Art.
⚠ The tab's LOOK is item 16's; do not tidy it separately.

**Read first:** `~/GloomsUnitFrames/CLAUDE.md` · [FINDINGS.md](FINDINGS.md) §18–§21

---

### 17 · Bar-shape art — the owner's sets
**Repo:** `~/GloomsHub` (`Media/art/barshapes/`, `Shapes.lua` BAR_SHAPE_DEF, `tools/gen-barshapes.py`) · **Size:** minutes per set · **Evidence:** the Tall crescent set imported and drawn 2026-09-21

The family has `Orb`, `Pill`, the generated **Bracket** set (owner: *"too thin, and I'm not even
sure they should be uniform … this isn't it"* — he will draw his own) and his **Tall crescent** set.
A set = one composition exported one member per file on the shared canvas, white on transparent;
the generator derives `-base-s` and three rim widths and prints the catalog rows with measured
footprints. **Size** on a set member scales the SET's footprint so members nest. Expect more sets
from him; each is: drop the files in, run the script, paste the rows.

**Read first:** the header of `~/GloomsHub/tools/gen-barshapes.py` · the BAR SHAPES block at the end of `~/GloomsHub/Shapes.lua`

## Not open — recorded so nobody re-raises them

> Full records in [ARCHIVE.md](ARCHIVE.md). Only what a session might realistically re-raise.

- **The Unit Frames tab tidy pass (item 13)** — **CLOSED 2026-09-21 as superseded**: the whole
  Suite UI is being redesigned from mocks (item 16). Do not tidy the old tab.
- **Audiowide for the redesign's wordmarks** — **WRONG, corrected by the owner 2026-09-21**: the
  Figma file uses **Michroma** everywhere; he had confused the two. Audiowide is not shipped.
- **The scrub dial as a jog wheel (ticks sliding under a fixed mark)** — **built and REJECTED
  2026-09-21**; so was the first cut (a needle riding over the ticks, hidden while dragging). The
  owner's definition is in `UI.dial`'s header. Do not rebuild either.
- **Offering the BUTTON shape catalog to a unit frame** — **RULED OUT by the owner 2026-09-21**:
  *"they are fundamentally different things."* GU reads only the Hub's BAR-shape family
  (`GloomsHub.BAR_SHAPES`); the mechanism is shared, the lists never mix in a picker.
- **A shared Offset X/Y between a display's arc and bar** — **RULED OUT 2026-09-21**: *"no scenario
  in which the X/Y placement would be the same."* Each mode keeps its own.
- **WCAG contrast thresholds for the redesign** — the owner **does not care** (2026-09-21): *"if I
  can read at age 50, it's not a problem."* Measure if asked; do not lecture.
- **The mid-combat ruling for GU** stands (2026-09-20): apply at regen is enough.

- **GU's "This spell" aura kind (one aura by spell ID, wearing a Hub effect)** — **REMOVED by the
  owner 2026-09-20.** On the player, the engine ignores `includeSpellIDs` AND `excludeSpellIDs` on
  HARMFUL auras — measured through a slot and a group, in either creation order, with a fresh filter
  table, against a permanent zone debuff (Void Breach) and a timed self-debuff (Blood Draw); the
  HELPFUL side and GA's HARMFUL slots on the TARGET filter correctly (FINDINGS §20.6). *"It needs
  to be able to track specific DEBUFFS to be of any value."* The Hub-effect-under-a-button machinery
  went with it, which is why **item 15 (Effects animating in combat) is CLOSED as moot** — nothing
  in the suite runs an effect under an aura button any more. The tab greys the spell-list boxes on a
  player Debuffs group and says why. **Do not rebuild it on the same engine call.** The "boss debuff
  on me" job is a Debuffs group with the *Boss debuffs* class filter.
- **An automatic "is the spell known?" check to fix the silent yes (item 6)** — **DISPROVED by trace
  2026-09-20**, FINDINGS §12: a bound, WORKING Corruption bar answers `known=no` on all three calls
  (it is keyed on the debuff's ID). Any known-check would hide working auras. The owner's
  Spell / Talent Known condition stands, and the Auras list now marks an aura whose cooldown trigger
  points at an UNBOUND spell (the `!` next to the eye) so the next Soul Fire warns before it fires.
- **"Why does GA's `ApplyConfig` run so hot?" (item 4)** — **ANSWERED and FIXED 2026-09-20**,
  FINDINGS §1 addendum: `UpdateBar` re-attached on every feed and cleared the style fingerprint, so
  every UNIT_AURA repainted every shown bar (1,165 pushes in a 30s dummy fight). The guard now keys
  on the painted BUTTON + style; after the fix, 3,227 skipped / 0 deferred. `/ga hot on` is the
  instrument, off by default.
- **A texture-less aura drawing magenta (item 9)** — **RULED and FIXED 2026-09-20**: it shows its
  spell's icon; an explicit texture always wins. Same resolver in the list rows.
- **`hgAnchor` in two places (item 10)** — **COLLAPSED 2026-09-20.** GB delegates to the Hub's
  `GrowAnchor`; the bodies were diffed identical first, the owner looked, nothing moved.
- **Items 1, 2, 5, 7, 8** — all **CLOSED 2026-09-20** on owner evidence (bars, raids for weeks,
  GB's profile clicks, the power condition on a Rogue incl. a group, `/ga debug`). ARCHIVE has it.
- **Settings changing MID-COMBAT, in GU** — the owner, 2026-09-20: *"People don't do that.
  Whether it updates mid-fight doesn't matter, as long as a change does at least go through after
  combat ends."* **Said for GU only — he corrected a suite-wide reading.** Do not QA GU's
  container rebuilds in combat; do make sure a refused write is replayed at regen.

- **"An absorb ARC on the health ring"** — **NOT POSSIBLE, measured 2026-09-19**, FINDINGS §19:
  no absorb-percent function exists, a curve refuses to evaluate a secret, and `UnitHealthPercent`'s
  flag does not include absorbs (34 / 34 with a 292K shield). What shipped is the shield WASH
  (presence via the plain-zero-then-secret alpha gate) and `[absorb]` as text. Reopen only on a new API.
- **"Start an aura icon's glow from the button's OnShow / from a child's OnUpdate"** — **NO**,
  FINDINGS §20: no script under an aura button ever fires and its `IsShown` is a secret boolean.
  Effects start at wiring time and live under the button; the Hub's modules verify their mask bind.
- **Class color + gradient on the health fill** — **mutually exclusive by the owner's call**
  (2026-09-19): a gradient wins, and the switch hides in gradient mode. Do not blend them.
- **A GA display as the "boss debuff on me" highlight** — **not the answer**: GA's displays are
  CDM-trackable auras; a boss debuff is not one. The GU "This spell" aura group is the tool for it.

- **"Draw the unit-frame rings with `SetGradient`, or hide an empty piece with alpha 0, or
  position anything with a secret"** — **NO, all measured 2026-09-19**, FINDINGS §18. A texture with
  `SetGradient` ignores a secret alpha; a secret alpha of exactly ZERO is ignored everywhere;
  `SetPoint` accepts a secret and drops it. The engine's gradient is a ramp *layer*, "empty" is
  geometry, and nothing is positioned by a value.
- **"A cast ring could use the Cooldown swipe"** — **never needed** (2026-09-20): the player's times
  are plain, and a target's fully secret cast draws through the duration object's percent
  evaluators on the ring's own curves (§18.10). Do not reach for the swipe.
- **"The cast ring hides when a target's total is secret"** — **KILLED 2026-09-20**, §18.10. The
  total is secret in every delve cast and the ring draws anyway.
- **Gloom's Unit Frames staying account-wide** — **RULED WRONG by the owner and REPLACED 2026-09-20.**
  Profiles ship (`GloomsUnitFramesDB` v2: a library + per-character bindings; the old config became
  "Default", which every unbound character lands on). Do not argue for the old shape.
- **"Rings over 180° can be one piece"** — **NO.** Masks only subtract; two chunks, overlapped by a
  hard-edged start mask. §18.

- **"Show the 3D model of an enemy targeted mid-combat in an instance"** — **NOT POSSIBLE, measured
  2026-09-19** (FINDINGS §17). On a restricted map the game identifies ONE unit for an addon: the
  target, out of combat. Nameplate units and mouseover are secret even before the pull; `SetUnit`
  on any of them loads nothing. What ships is the ceiling: 3D out of combat, 3D for a mob targeted
  before the pull when tabbed back to (nameplate-matched, `SetCreature`), the correct 2D portrait
  otherwise, flipping back to 3D when combat drops. The owner called it "so fucking lame" and he is
  right; **do not re-chase it without a NEW API.** `UnitIsUnit("target","nameplateN")` being a real
  boolean in combat is the one door that is open, and it is already used.
- **A ROUND-BOTTOMED 3D bust (a mask on a PlayerModel)** — **IMPOSSIBLE on the current client**
  (2026-09-19). A `PlayerModel` is a live viewport into a rectangle, not a texture; `MaskTexture`,
  `SetClipsChildren` and alpha all act on textures or rectangles, and there is no render-to-texture
  for addons. A corner matte hides the world under the corners; slicing into clipped copies is
  jagged, heavy and the copies' idle animations drift apart. **Becomes a one-liner if Blizzard ever
  ships model-to-texture — that is the only trigger for reopening it.** The owner wants it; record
  the wish, not a hack.
- **The WoWup / GitHub-Releases distribution path** — **RETIRED by the owner, 2026-09-19.** He runs
  every suite addon as a SYMLINK for development; WoWup's GitHub install "doesn't work very well"
  (learned on Build Barn and Loot Advisor, both moved to CurseForge). Tags still cut a GitHub
  Release as a version marker, nothing more. **If the suite ever goes public it goes through
  CurseForge**, and he will say when. Do not frame changes as "so WoWup picks it up", do not verify
  `latest` for WoWup's sake, do not tell him to install from a release.
- **Gloom's Portraits keeping its own minimap button / floating panel / slash subcommands** — all
  **GONE with stage 2** (2026-09-19). The suite has ONE launcher; `/gp` opens the tab; the tab's
  open/close IS the lock. Reset lives in the tab's rail.

- **"GB's per-character profiles don't work / my alt looks wrong"** — **FIXED 2026-08-15**, FINDINGS
  §11. Login never loaded the bound profile. ⚠ The old bug already overwrote some saved presets;
  a character may look wrong ONCE after the fix, then stay stable. That is not a new bug.
- **GB profile New vs Copy** — **SETTLED 2026-08-15.** New = the factory look; Copy = a full
  duplicate of the active profile. GA and Overlays already worked this way; GB was the outlier and
  now matches. Do not "restore" New to snapshotting the current look.
- **GB's PRESET block being orange and at the bottom of the rail** — **the owner asked for it**
  (2026-08-15) so the two blocks stop reading as one control. Not a mistake, not a token drift.
- **GA duration bars on 12.1** — **BUILT and owner-QA'd 2026-08-12** via `AuraContainer`. Mechanism
  and traps in FINDINGS §1 and `~/GloomsAuras/docs/HANDOFF.md`. Do not redesign it.
- **The Tracked-Bar mirror** (`BarMirrorValues`, `StartMirror`/`StopMirror`) — **DELETED 2026-08-12.**
  It worked but needed a per-aura Blizzard config step. **Do not rebuild it**; FINDINGS §1.
- **A display not returning after a mid-combat `/reload`** — **CLOSED, not fixable through the
  presence mirror.** `TESTED` over 52 passes: the CDM never binds an already-applied aura to its
  item frame after a reload. Three fixes were attempted and all three failed. FINDINGS §1.
- **`GetValidAlertTypes` as a general "can this trigger fire?" oracle** — **NO.** It reports Agony
  as unable to do apply/remove, which is false. Only its *pandemic* column matches observation.
  FINDINGS §10.
- **How ArcUI does DoT timers** — **SOLVED**, FINDINGS §1. Do not reverse-engineer it again.
- **Combat-log / self-timed duration bars** — **do not build.** FINDINGS §1, option 2.
- **"GA is broken in combat on 12.1" / "the Warlock profile is broken"** — **FALSE**, FINDINGS §1.
- **`GetPlayerAuraBySpellID` as the deciding test** — **tested, returns `nil`**; player-only.
- **The damage-meter Lua error storm** — **NOT OUR BUG** (FINDINGS §9). Do not re-diagnose.
- **Quick Keybind Mode "blocked by GB's skin"** — **CLOSED, not a GB bug** (FINDINGS §8).
- **GB's per-action icon overrides (`GB.Icons`)** — **SHIPPED and owner-QA'd.** No config UI wanted.
  **Do not build tooling to find icon art.** ⚠ `IconsHD/` is git-ignored and `IconsManifest.lua`
  ships EMPTY — the mechanism ships, the owner's art does not. **Never commit a populated manifest.**
- **GB's icon zoom applying to every preset** — **FIXED and owner-QA'd 2026-07-26.**
- **GA telling GB to glow a real action button** — **RULED OUT by the owner, 2026-08-25.** It was
  offered twice as the exact fix for "make the Cataclysm button glow" (perfect shape, perfect
  alignment, follows the bars automatically). He declined both times: *"I don't really want an aura
  telling GB what to do — that's a level of complexity that I suspect would introduce more problems
  than it solved."* **He is content aligning an aura over a button by hand.** Do not re-offer it.
- **"GA's shape/animation does nothing"** — check WHICH shape and WHICH texture before believing it.
  Measured against the icon rect, `roundsq1` crops **1.2%**, `roundsq2` 4.7%, `circle` 21.4%,
  `diamond` 50.1%. A rounded square over soft-edged art is a legitimately invisible change.
  Animations additionally need a Shape set — with none they are skipped by design. FINDINGS §14.
- **Distribution to friends/guild** — not ready; the owner will say when.
- **The user's own media shipping in the addon** — FIXED and purged. **Never re-track them.**
- **The colour picker** — **FULLY owner-QA'd.** IN USE holds the USER's colours; it is not modal.
- **GB's empty-button collapse hiding the CONTAINER** — **MOVED to the alpha path 2026-08-24**,
  FINDINGS §13. Blizzard re-shows containers and GB is combat-gagged, so the hide could never hold.
  **Do not reinstate `cont:SetShown(false)` for empties**; comments at both ends say so.
- **"Gloom's Hub says my fonts did not load, but they work"** — **FIXED 2026-09-08**, FINDINGS §5.
  The probe read its own first cold draw as the verdict, so it accused every drop-in catalog font on
  every cold client start and never on `/reload`. It now re-checks ~2s later and reports only what
  fails twice. ⚠ **The warning is still worth having** — a real typo or a deleted `.ttf` fails both
  passes. **Do not gate font REGISTRATION on it**; that reasoning is unchanged and is what kept the
  owner's fonts working throughout.
- **"Buttons past the bar's count reappear in combat"** — **FIXED 2026-09-05**, FINDINGS §13 (see
  the AMENDED block). Same mechanism as the empty-slot case, in the count path that was left behind.
  Out-of-grid containers are now alpha-0 AND parked off-screen. ⚠ **The trigger is HOVERING the bars
  in combat** — without that it will not reproduce, which is not the same as being fixed. **Do not
  "simplify" the parking away**: alpha alone leaves an invisible button clickable on top of live
  ones.
- **`C_Spell.IsSpellUsable` being simply banned** — **QUALIFIED 2026-08-24**, FINDINGS §12. Still
  invalid ALONE; valid ANDed with the cooldown mirror, and it is the only signal that sees a proc.
  GA's `CASTABLE` trigger state is built on that pairing.
- **Sourcing the "comes off cooldown" sound from events only** — **TRIED and WRONG**, FINDINGS §12.
  `CooldownFrame_Clear` is not reliably fired; the polled reconciler is sometimes the only witness.
  Judge the transition's DURATION, not which writer noticed. Do not re-split by source.
- **A settle/debounce timer on the ready sound** — **REMOVED**, it swallowed real sounds.
  `CDM:PlaySound`'s 1s per-display throttle already handles duplicates.
- **"The owner has stale Hunter auras"** — **FALSE.** Those live in OTHER CHARACTERS' profiles.
  ⚠ `GloomsAurasDB`/`GloomsBarsDB` hold one profile per character and display IDs restart in each
  (`d18` exists several times). **Any script reading them must be profile-aware** — grabbing the
  first regex match produced two confidently wrong diagnoses on 2026-08-24.
- **Reporting EllesmereUI's font-cache bugs upstream** — **DECLINED by the owner, 2026-09-19.**
  FINDINGS §16 names both bugs; the Hub-side fix makes them moot for us. Do not draft the report.
- **"Make the bar FILL change colour in the pandemic window"** — **NOT BUILT, by design** (2026-09-19).
  The fill is the engine's Blizzard button and cannot be restyled in combat (FINDINGS §1, §15); the
  owner chose the BACKDROP and it shipped. Do not re-offer the fill.
- **Immolate's pandemic sound firing every ~21s** — **NOT A BUG** (measured 2026-08-24: ~7 in 4.5
  minutes). A Destruction rotation refreshes into the pandemic window constantly and the alert fires
  each time; the spurious falloff one is separately suppressed (FINDINGS §12). Raised with the owner;
  **he did not ask for anything.** Do not build a rate limit unprompted.
