# Gloom Suite — STATE ledger

> **This is the single answer to "where are we?" Read it FIRST for any suite work.
> UPDATE it at the end of any session that moves the suite.** Home of record: this repo.
> Full design in [SUITE-PLAN.md](SUITE-PLAN.md). Shared contracts in [CONTRACTS.md](CONTRACTS.md).

**Last updated:** 2026-07-24 (session that built Phases A **and** B; both QA gates passed by the owner same day).

## Phase status

| Phase | What | Status |
|---|---|---|
| — | Scaffold GloomsHub repo + symlink + docs (home of record) | **DONE (not QA'd — no code yet)** |
| **A** | Stand up GloomsHub, media-only (registration + resolver + ST→Hub copy-migration + compat shim + asset folders). Touch nothing else. | **DONE — QA'd by the owner 2026-07-24** (clean BugSack; DrukMedium serves from the Hub; catalog 1 font / 6 textures / 36 graphics, `migratedFromST = true`; Overlays unaffected). Known transition artifact: ST prints "skipped — already registered" lines at login because the Hub (loads first) now wins the LSM names — harmless, ST's own code, gone at Phase F. |
| **B** | Empty tabbed shell + Media tab. Add `/gloom`. Old windows still work. | **DONE — QA'd by the owner 2026-07-24** (window/toggle/Escape/drag; catalog 1/6/36 with previews; accordion + orange scrollbar; add/remove incl. `.otf` rejection; old windows untouched; cold-start re-verified). Two findings baked in: (1) **cold-start blank-text quirk** — WoW draws a cold (font file, size) pair blank the first time each session (a /reload heals, next cold start re-breaks); fixed by Skin.lua's `UI.WarmFonts` login pre-warmer — EXTEND its pair list whenever new UI font sizes appear (Phase C!). (2) overlapping family windows interleave (same strata, pre-existing GB/GA quirk) — accepted by the owner; self-resolves as tools mount tabs (C–E). |
| **C** | Migrate Gloom's Bars as the proof (Bars tab, `/gb` reroute, toolkit → LibGloomSkin). | **NOT STARTED** ← next |
| **D** | Migrate Gloom's Auras (Auras tab; flip `CatStoneTweaks` → `GloomsHub:ListMedia`). | not started |
| **E** | Rename VibeOverlay → Gloom's Overlays; mount Overlays tab; **reskin in one go**. | not started |
| **F** | Retire StoneTweaks (delete last, non-destructively). | not started |
| **G** | Packaging/release: `.pkgmeta`, `## Dependencies: GloomsHub`, embed LibGloomSkin, WoWup. | not started |

## Locked decisions (do not reopen — see SUITE-PLAN §"Decisions locked")
- Shared base = **GloomsHub** (permanent asset path `Interface\AddOns\GloomsHub\…`).
- StoneTweaks fully retired; media half absorbed into the Hub as the **Media tab**. No standalone media addon.
- VibeOverlay → **Gloom's Overlays**, reskinned in one go. `Vibe` name dropped.
- Four separate addons + one shared base (NOT a mega-addon). Hub ships as its own release; GB/GA/Overlays hard-depend on it.
- **HARD dependency on GloomsHub — NO standalone fallback (the owner, 2026-07-24).** Each tool
  deletes its own window; its config renders ONLY inside the Hub's tabbed shell. Installing a
  tool WITHOUT the Hub = its config has nowhere to render. This is the safer choice for keeping
  the experience identical everywhere (one window, one toolkit, zero drift). `## Dependencies:
  GloomsHub` makes WoWup + the in-game addon list flag the missing dep LOUDLY. Chosen over a
  graceful-fallback (own-window-if-no-Hub) precisely to avoid two window paths that could drift.
  Distribution is limited (friends/guild), so "someone installs one tool alone" is a known,
  acceptable, loudly-failing edge — not a silent break.
- **Gloom's Build Barn is OUT of the suite** (data-fed cron pipeline, not a tab tool). Do not fold it in.

## What's physically in place right now
- `~/GloomsHub` git repo, symlinked into AddOns as `GloomsHub` (matches GB/GA convention).
- `Core.lua` (namespace, `GloomsHubDB`, ST copy-migration, dormant compat shim, `/gh` probe),
  `Skin.lua` (**the** suite tokens `GloomsHub.COLOR/.FONT` per CONTRACTS §1 + `GloomsHub.UI`
  toolkit + `UI.WarmFonts` login font pre-warmer), `Shell.lua` (the Suite window:
  `RegisterTab/Open/FocusTab/ToggleWindow` + `/gloom`), `Media.lua` (LSM registration,
  `ResolveAssetPath`, `ListMedia`, `Media:Add*/Remove*` API + the Media tab),
  `GloomsHub.toc` (Libs → Core → Skin → Shell → Media), `CLAUDE.md`, the 4 docs.
- `Libs/` (gitignored): LibStub, CallbackHandler-1.0, LibSharedMedia-3.0 (from `~/GloomsAuras/Libs/`).
- `Fonts/` (8 files), `Textures/` (13), `Graphics/` (45) — committed ST-salvaged assets.
- `Media/fonts/` (Khand ×2 + GeneralSans ×3, copied from GB) + `Media/ui/caret.png`.
  (Still missing: Hub logo / `Media\ui\minimap.png` for the TOC IconTexture — open item.)
- **Live on the owner's account:** `GloomsHubDB` = 1 font / 6 textures / 36 graphics,
  `migratedFromST = true`, plus `lastTab`; Hub wins the LSM names (ST prints skip lines);
  compat shim dormant. GB/GA/VibeOverlay/StoneTweaks still completely untouched.
- GB & GA `CLAUDE.md` carry a "part of the Gloom Suite → GloomsHub" pointer.

## Open (non-blocking) questions — see SUITE-PLAN §6
Overlays slash name; shared-footer contents; compat-shim lifetime; final LibGloomSkin public surface; stray `BoordensStreet.otf` fate.

## How to keep this honest
Any session that edits GB/GA/Overlays/Hub **for suite reasons** updates the relevant phase row
here before finishing. A phase is "DONE" only when its SUITE-PLAN QA gate has been met by the owner;
mark "in progress" until then.
